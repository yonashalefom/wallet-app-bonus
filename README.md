## 📱 How It Works

### Daily Points Calculation
The app features a sophisticated points system that calculates daily rewards based on seasonal patterns:

- **Seasonal Basis**: Points reset each season (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter)
- **Progressive Algorithm**: 
  - Day 1: 2 points
  - Day 2: 3 points
  - Day N: Previous day's points × 60% + Day before previous × 100%
- **Smart Formatting**: Large numbers displayed as "K" format (e.g., 28745 → "29K")

### Transaction Management
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant status changes from pending to approved
- **Smart Date Display**: Recent transactions show relative dates (Yesterday, Tuesday)
- **Merchant Recognition**: Automatic icon assignment based on transaction type
- **Family Support**: Track transactions made by authorized users

### Navigation Flow
1. **Dashboard View**: Overview of balance, points, and recent transactions
2. **Transaction Details**: Tap any transaction to view full details
3. **Seamless Navigation**: Smooth transitions between screens
